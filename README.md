This repository implements the whole [DECODEproject](https://decodeproject.eu)'s Petition Pilot over the [Sawtooth](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/) blockchain distributed by the Linux Foundation's [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/) consortium.

To facilitate the creation of transaction families based on [Zenroom VM](https://zenroom.dyne.org) and the [Zencode human-friendly language for smart-contracts](https://decodeproject.eu/blog/smart-contracts-english-speaker), this TP uses the [Sawtooth SDK](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/sdks.html) in Python and the [zenroom-py](https://github.com/DECODEproject/zenroom-py) bindings.
